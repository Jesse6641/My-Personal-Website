        <p1>Hello, my name is Jesse Herrera and welcome to my domain. I am very impressed<br>
        and joyful that I can create this. Anyways, I am currently a rising senior from Chavez<br> 
        High School located in my hometown, Houston,TX. I am enrolled in my school's IB Program<br> 
        (International Baccalaureate) which is a very rigorous program which requires me to take<br> 
        7 IB classes in order to get a different diploma (IB Diploma). I come from a family of 4<br> 
        (my mother, my older sister, younger brother, and me). I aspire to become a civil engineer<br>
        and want to attend MIT. If you want to connect here is my LinkedIn.<br>
